# The project
## Build and start the project

### Development
``` nodejs
npm run Development
``` 
Will run the this command: 
"dev": "webpack serve --config ./src/client/webpack.dev.js",

## Typescript with ThreeJS 
Playing with typescript and threejs. Will soon start looking at sub-division surfaces.
